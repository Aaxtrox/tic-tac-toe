# tic-tac-toe
"Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Two players take turns: one uses "X" and the other "O." They place their symbols in empty cells on the grid. The game ends when a player forms the winning pattern or when all cells are filled, resulting in a draw."
